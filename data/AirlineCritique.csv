Just spent 45 minutes on hold with customer service. Pretty sure I learned Morse code in the process. #NeverGiveUp
"Seriously, airline food has officially hit a new low. My mystery meat sandwich is making me question my entire culinary existence. #HangryTraveler"
Why do airlines charge extra for everything these days? Breathing on the plane? $10. Using the bathroom? $20. Holding your sanity together? Priceless. #GreedAirlines
"Sorry, your carry-on is too big. Me, with a backpack smaller than a chihuahua:  But it literally fits under the seat.  Airlines: logic optional. #PackingStruggles"
Witnessing the worst case of airplane rage ever. Guy yelling at the flight attendant because the peanuts are stale. This is why we can't have nice things. #FlyingFury
"Pretty sure the person next to me has applied their entire bottle of cologne to their armpits. It's an olfactory assault, but hey, at least I'm awake now. #AirborneAromatherapy"
"Babies crying, turbulence rocking the plane, guy snoring like a chainsaw... just another day in paradise, aka economy class. #FirstWorldProblems"
I'm convinced airlines use tiny cups for drinks just to make refills more frequent. Genius marketing or cruel torture? You decide. #HydrationHustle

"Just saw a toddler try to flush his toy car in the airplane toilet.  SkyHigh, please send a plumber and a therapist."
"My seatmate's snoring is putting the engine to shame.  SkyHigh, can I trade for the emergency exit row? Just kidding...mostly. ✈️"

"Soar & Snore Airlines claims  luxury travel ? More like  cattle class torture chamber.  Seats tighter than my bank account after Christmas, food drier than the Sahara, and service colder than an ex's heart.  #FalseAdvertising #RefundPlease"
"In-flight entertainment on Sky Snooze Express: broken screens, dead headphones, and the only movie option was  Snakes on a Plane  (ironic, considering the state of this aircraft). Guess I'll just stare at the back of the seat in front of me for hours.  #BoredOutOfMyMind"
Pretty sure the safety briefing on Wind Whispers Airways included instructions on how to survive a mutiny. Not a good sign.  #MaydayMayday #SOS

"Just deplaned from Cloudy Chaos Cruises feeling like I've aged years. Lost luggage, delayed flight, and enough crying babies to power a small city. Is this what they call  frequent flyer program rewards ?  #ExhaustedAF #SendHelp"
"Dear Soggy Pretzel Express, next time you advertise  complimentary snacks,  maybe don't mean stale pretzels and lukewarm water. My goldfish wouldn't even touch that garbage. ️ #HangryAF #FalsePromises"
"Pretty sure the pilot on my Turbulent Times Travels flight was using the autopilot for both the plane and his emotional state. Zero communication, just steely silence and some aggressive banking turns. ✈️ #WhiteKnuckleRide #HopeWeLand"

" Please turn off your devices...  Oh, so you mean my sanity lifeline on this 12-hour flight? ✈️"
Witnessed a Tetris masterclass trying to shove an oversized carry-on into the overhead bin. May the baggage claim gods have mercy. ✈️
Pretty sure the flight attendant gave me the death stare for pilfering half the peanuts from the snack mix. Worth the risk. ✈️
This plane is packed tighter than a clown car. Can't decide if the cramped legroom or hairspray fumes are more potent. ✈️
Airplane food: the ultimate test of human desperation for a decent meal. ✈️
"Spent two hours chatting with the most delightful 90-year-old lady about her travels. Proof that airplanes can be magical, indeed. ✨✈️"
